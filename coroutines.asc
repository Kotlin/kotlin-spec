PROPOSAL DRAFT: ADDING COROUTINES TO KOTLIN
===========================================

This is a draft of the proposal for adding coroutine support to the Kotlin language (http://kotlinlang.org).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction
============

Let's examine a normal "lifetime" of a method invocation. Usually, an execution of a particular method always starts at a single entry point, continues without interruption, following the control flow path (or one of serveral possible control flow path, with branches selected depending on some conditions) until it reaches one of its exit points, where the method returns some return value and control to its immediate caller, at which moment the execution of the method is completed. The set of parameters and local variables specific to this particular invocation of the method (usually referred to as a stack frame) ceases to exist at that moment, unless some of them have been captured in a closure that outlives the method invocation. The mechanism of exceptions (that can be seen as a simple form of non-local control transfer), introduces some minor modifications into this process.

In some scenarios it is desirable to have a more involved behavior than the one just described. It may be necessary to suspend an execution of a method at a certain expression(s) in its body, and transfer the control flow elsewhere (usually with some additional data). The execution of the method is not yet complete at this point, and the set of its parameters and local variables is preserved, so that the execution of the method can be resumed at some later moment at exactly the same point where it has been suspended. A possible motivation for this case is that rather than computing and returning the whole return value (e.g. a list) at once, parts of that value can become known earlier, and it is desirable to make them available to the calling code immediately, without waiting for the completion of the method (this is a typical scenario when implementing generators or iterators). Another motivation is to start execution of a method immediately when it can be scheduled by the execution environment (OS, VM, etc.), when not all data required by the method is available yet. The missing data can be represented by an object encapsulating a delayed computation, that is usually known as a task, future or promise. When the method execution reaches a point when the missing data is required to continue execution, but it is not yet available, the method execution is suspended until the data becomes available. It is usually said that the task/future/promise is awaited at this point. A functional value representing the continuation of the suspended method can be subscribed to be invoked when the task/future/promise is completed.

So languages provide a predefined set of language-supported coroutine kinds with mostly fixed behavior, tied to certain predefined types. A method implementing a coroutine is converted to a state machine, whose states correspond to points in the method body where the execution of the method can be suspended. The state machine is an object (usually of an anonymous compiler-generated class) allocated on the heap (so, its lifetime is not restricted by a lifetime of a certain stack frame). Parameters and local variables of the method become fields of the object reperesing the state machine, and the method body is encapsulated (with some pertinent transformation) into one (or sometimes more) methods of the object. The object usually has an additional field storing a sequential number of the current state. An invocation of the coroutine usually returns an instance of a predefined class or an interface, representing the coroutine and providing some methods to observe or control its current state, subscribe to its completion or combine it with other objects of the same or similar type. The actual invocation of the coroutine may have already stated prior to returning the result (as often happens with futures), or may have to be manually started by invocation of a certain method (as often happens with lazy generators). So a language prescribes both how a continuation is transformed into a state machine, and how a public API of the state machine looks and behaves. In our view, this approach limits the scope of those features, and restricts their applicability and usefulness. If an asynchronous lazy generator is required in a certain scenraio, it has to wait until this particular kind of coroutines is implemented in the language (or, more probably, has to be manually written using lower-level language constructs, that is both error-prone and obscuring the idea the programmer has in mind). Apparently, it also increases burden on compiler developers, who need to design, implement and test support for every new kind of coroutines in the language.

We propose an alternative approach, where the compiler is only controls the transformation of the coroutine body ito a state machine, why its public API and precise behavior can be defined in a library. So, new kind of coroutines can easily be introduced by using or creating new libraries, without any changes to the language.

Here is a summary of our proposal. Some details, in particular, syntax rules, are chosen quite arbitrarily and are not intended to represent a final design. For simplicity, we assume that transformation of coroutines to stack machine happens only for function literals, not named functions (this restriction can be lifted leter if deemed necessary). To distinguish function literals representing coroutines, we prefix them with an ampersand: `&{...} `. Every coroutine has an associated controller object. We write an expression (usually, a variable) that evaluates to the controller object, immediately before the coroutine: `ctrl &{...}`. The controller is responsible for governing the coroutine life cycle, and provide an API allowing other parts of the program to interact with the coroutine. The type C of the controller object is not prescribed exactly. We assume that the type C has a non-empty set of methods marked with the modifier `cofun` (typical names of those methods are `yield` and `await`). These methods are available within the coroutine body by their simple names, but with signatures different than the ones specified in their declarations. The locations in the coroutine body where any of these methods is invoked are called suspension points.

The coroutine itself is converted by the compiler into a state machine, implemented by an anonymous compiler-generated class S. The body of the coroutine, with some tranformations explained below, is converted to a method of S named `invoke` (for simplicity, we omit details of transformations of try-catch-finally statements). The parameters and local variables of the coroutine are converted to fields of the class S (unless they are captured in a nested anonymous function and so are already have to be converted to fields of a class representing a closure). The class S has an integer field named `state` storing the index of the current state of the state machine. Every evaluation of the expression `ctrl &{...}` creates a new instance of S, passes it as a single argument to the method of C called `create`, and the result of the evaluation of the expression `ctrl &{...}` is whatever value of whatever type returned by the method `create` (typically, it is a future or a lazy sequence). The controller, depending on its purposes, are free to perform the first invocation of the method `invoke` of S synchronously before returning from `create`, or at some later moment, possibly triggered by an invocation of a method in its public API (this corresponds to an immediate or delayed start of the coroutine). The method `invoke` typically has a parameter (TODO: figure out the rules about its typing), but an argument for this parameter is ignored for the first invocation of the `invoke` method. The body of the invoke method (recall that is has been constructed from the coroutine body) is enclosed in a `when` statement controlled by the `state` variable, each branch of the `when` statement represents a part of the coroutine between two consecutive suspension points. The evaluation rules for each branch are the regular rules that apply for non-coroutine blocks. A local variable that is used strictly within a single branch may be implemented as a regular local by the compiler, without promoting it to a field of the state machine. The branch corresponding to the initial state is the part of the coroutine between its entry point and its first suspension point. It executes on the first call to `invoke`, and ends when the control reaches the expression representing the first suspension point. Assume that this point has the form `val x = foo(bar(), yield(baz()), qux())` where `yield` is a `cofun` methos. The subexpressions `bar()` and `baz()` belong to the first branch, the result of `bar()` is stowed, and the result of `baz()` is used in the invocation of the `yield` method. The subexpression `val x = foo(<result of bar>, <result of yield>, qux())` belongs to the second branch (so, the second branch first unstows the result of `bar()`, then retrieves a value passed from outside to serve as the result of `yield`, then invokes `qux`, then invokes `foo` with 3 arguments on the evaluation stack and, finally, assign the result of `foo` to the local variable `x` and proceeds with the further evaluation of the second branch).
the similar process happens at the beginning of the third and other branches.

Let's inspect in more details the invocation of `yield`. This is a pseudo-function, in the sense that it syntactically looks like a regular function invocation, but is performed in a different way. Its argument(s) are passed to the corresponding parameters of the function named `yield` with the modifier `cofun` in the controller, but the return type of that declaration is `Unit` and it typically returns immediately back to the `invoke` method after storing its arguments within the controller. Then the `invoke` function returns immediately `true` to its caller (that can be `create` or another method of the controller).

Terminology
===========
* An _anonymous routine_ (TODO: find simpler term?) -- an umbrella term, covering both function literals and coroutines (for the definition of coroutines, see below). The term "anonymous routine" is purely syntactical. An anonymous routine is delimited with curly braces `{...}`. The code between the curly braces is called the _content_ of the anonymous routine. The content may be empty (i.e. have no tokens). The content may optionally start with an _explicit parameter list_ (ending with the right arrow token `->`). The rest of the content is called the _body_ of the anonymous routine. The explicit parameter list may be empty (i.e. consist of the single right arrow token `->`). Alternatively, an anonymous routine may have no explicit argument list at all, in which case its content consists of its body only. [Note: A missing explicit parameter list does not necessarily mean that the anonymous routine has no parameters. If so implied by its type context, it may have a single implicit parameter called `it`. End note]

* A _coroutine_ -- a block of code (possibly, parameterized) whose execution can be suspended and resumed potentially multiple times (possibly, at several different points), yielding the control to its caller. [Note: The wording "potentially multiple times" should be understood as "zero, one or more times". While it is rarely useful, a coroutine can we written in a way such that it is never suspended at all. End note]. 

Syntactically, a coroutine looks exactly as a function literal `{ x, y -> ... }` and, indeed, coroutines and function literals are grouped together under the syntactical umbrella term "anonymous routines". A coroutine is distinguished by the compiler from a function literal based on the special type context in which it occurs. A coroutine is typechecked using different rules it in a different way than a regular function literal converts it to a state machine object.

resulting in a sequence of steps, whose local state is persistent between different steps. .   The resemblance of coroutines to function literals is purely syntactical. When the term "a function literal" is used in this specification without any additional qualification, it does NOT include coroutines. Sometimes the term "a regular function literal" is used to highlight its semantic difference from coroutines, but the qualification "regular" is strictly redundant here. There is another syntactical aspect, where coroutines can be written in a way similar to function literals. Namely, if a coroutine appears as the last argument to a function invocation, it can be specified outside of the parenthesized argument list, immediately following it (if there are no other arguments, then the empty argument list `()` can be omitted entirely). 

[Note: Some languages with coroutine support allow coroutines to take forms both of an anonymous function and of a method body. Kotlin supports only one syntactic flavor of coroutines, resembling function literals. In case where a coroutine in the form of a method body would be used in another language, in Kotlin such method would typically be a regular method with an expression body, consisting of an invocation expression whose last argument is a coroutine. End note] 

[Note: When a regular function `f` invokes another function (that, in turn, can make other invocations), the execution of `f` is, in a sense, suspended with the control flow transferred to the callee, and is resumed later, when the callee returns. The local state of `f` is preserved on stack during the nested call, and this does not require any additional machinery. This observation does not mean that every function is a coroutine. We only classify a function as a coroutine, if it is possible to preserve its local state not relying on the current call stack, suspend it execution and transfer the control flow to its caller (the caller might redirect it elsewhere). The caller typically gets ahold of a some sort of handle that allows it to resume the execution of the coroutine at a later point. End note]

* Suspension point -- a special expression in a coroutine that designates a point where the execution of the coroutine is suspended. Syntactically, a suspension point looks exactly as a function invocation. It is recognized by the compiler as a suspension point by its name, that shall match one of the special methods provided by the controller. but is evaluated in a different way than a regular function invocation. The arguments to the invocation (including the receiver expression, if any) are evaluated first, in normal left-to-right order. Then the arguments are made available to the controller, and the execution of the coroutine is suspended. When the controller resumes the coroutine, it provides a value that becomes the result of the invocation expression.

* Yielding invocation -- a special kind of a function invocation expression within a coroutine, corresponding to a suspension point of that coroutine. A yielding invocation is syntactically indistinguishable from a regular function invocation (and, indeed, is classified as a special case of an invocation expression), but is recognized by the compiler by its name, that shall match the name of a method of the controller having a special annotation (TODO: what annotation?). The typechecking and evaluation rules of a yielding invocation are different from those of a regular function invocation. Like any invocation expression, a yielding invocation has an argument list (that may include)


* Local state (in a coroutine) -- the set of parameters and local variables declared within a coroutine (excluding any nested functions and coroutines), with the current set of values assigned to them. Because coroutines unlike regular functions, can be suspended with a 
* State machine -- An object of an anonymous compiler-generated class, encapsulating the behavior and state of a coroutine

* Controller

* Step

* Task

* Return value

* Continuation -- a value of a functional type pointing to a position in a coroutine immediately after one of its suspension points. A continuation for a given coroutine is said to be _current_ if the coroutine is currently suspended, and the continuation points to a position immediately after its current suspension point. A suspended coroutine is typically resumed by an invocation of its current continuation. After the coroutine has been resumed, the continuation ceases to be current, and is said to be _expired_. An invocation of an expired continuation results in an undefined behavior.
