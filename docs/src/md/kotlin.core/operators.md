## Operator overloading

Some syntax forms in Kotlin are *defined by convention*, meaning that their semantics are defined through syntactic expansion of one syntax form into another syntax form.

Particular cases of definition by convention include:

- Arithmetic and comparison operators;
- `invoke` convention;
- Operator-form [assignments][Assignments];
- [For-loop statements][For-loop statements];
- [Delegated properties][Delegated property declaration];
- [Destructuring declarations][Destructuring declarations].

> Important: another case of definition by convention is [safe navigation][Navigation operators], which is covered in more detail in its respective section.

There are several points shared among all the syntax forms defined using definition by convention:

- The expansions are hygienic: if they introduce new identifiers that were not present in original syntax, all such identifiers are not accessible outside the expansion and cannot clash with any other declarations in the program;
- The expressions captured by an expansion are using *call-by-need* evaluation strategy, meaning that they are evaluated only once during first usage specified in the expansion even if the expansion itself has more than one usage of such an expression;
- An expansion may lead to another expansion, following the same rules;
- All call expressions that are produced by expansion are only allowed to use operator functions.

This expansion of a particular syntax form to a different piece of code is usually defined in the terms of *operator* functions.

Operator functions are function which are [declared][Function declaration] with a special keyword `operator` and are not different from regular functions when called via [function calls][Function calls and property access].
However, operator functions can also be used in definition by convention.

> Note: it is not important whether an operator function is a member or an extension, nor whether it is suspending or not.
> The only requirements are the ones listed in the respected sections.
>
> For example, for an operator form `a + b` where `a` is of type `A` and `b` is of type `B` any of the following function definitions are applicable:
>
> ```kotlin
> class A {
>     // member function 
>     operator fun plus(b: B) = ... 
>     // suspending member function
>     suspend operator fun plus(b: B) = ... 
> }
> 
> // extension function
> operator fun A.plus(b: B) = ...
> // suspending extension function
> suspend operator fun A.plus(b: B) = ...
> ```
> 
> Assuming additional implicit receiver of this type is available, it may also be an extension defined in another type:
>
> ```kotlin
> object Ctx {
>     // extension that is a member of some context type
>     operator fun A.plus(b: B) = ...
> 
>     fun add(a: A, b: B) = a + b
> }
> ```

> Note: different platforms may add additional criteria on whether a function may be considered a suitable candidate for operator convention.

The details of individual expansions are available in the sections of their respective operators, here we would like to describe how they *interoperate*.

For example, take the following declarations:

```kotlin
class A {
    operator fun inc(): A { ... }
}

object B {
    operator fun get(i: Int): A { ... }
    operator fun set(i: Int, value: A) { ... }
}

object C {
    operator fun get(i: Int): B { ... }
}

```

The expression `C[0][0]++` is expanded (see the [Expressions][expressions] section for details) using the following rules:

- The operations are expanded in order of their priority(TODO(Where and how to specify this priority?)).

- First, the [increment operator][Postfix increment expressions] is expanded, resulting in:
  
    ```kotlin
    C[0][0] = C[0][0].inc()
    ```
- Second, the [assignment][Assignments] to an indexing expression (produced by the previous expansion) is expanded, resulting in:
  
    ```kotlin
    C[0].set(0, C[0][0].inc())
    ```
- Third, the [indexing expressions][Indexing expressions] are expanded, resulting in:
  
    ```kotlin
    C.get(0).set(0, C.get(0).get(0).inc())
    ```

TODO(Specify when we run the overload resolution to know what we're expanding to)

> Important: although the resulting expression contains several instances of the subexpression `C.get(0)`, as all these instances were created from the same original syntax form, the subexpression is evaluated only once, making this code roughly equivalent to:
> 
> ```kotlin
> val $tmp = C.get(0)
> $tmp.set(0, $tmp.get(0).inc())
> ```

### Destructuring declarations

A special case of definition by convention is the destructuring declaration of properties, which is available for [local properties][Local property declaration], parameters of [lambda literals][Lambda literals] and the iteration variable of [for-loops][For-loop statements].
See the corresponding sections for particular syntax.

This convention allows to introduce a number (one or more) of properties in the place of one by immediately *destructuring* the property during construction.
The immediate value (that is, the initializing expression of the local property, the value acquired from the operator convention of a for-loop statement, or an argument passed into a lambda body) is assigned to a number of placeholders $p_0, \ldots, p_N$ where each placeholder is either an identifier or a special ignoring placeholder `_` (note that `_` is not a valid identifier in Kotlin).
For each identifier the corresponding operator function `componentK` with $K$ being equal to the position of the placeholder in the declaration (**starting from 1**) is called without arguments and the result is assigned to a fresh value referred to as the identifier used.
For each ignoring placeholder, no calls are performed and nothing is assigned.
Each placeholder may be provided with an optional type signature $T_M$ which is used in [type inference][Type inference] as any property type would.
Note that an ignoring placeholder may also be provided with a type signature, in which case although the call to corresponding `componentM` function is not performed, it still must be checked for function applicability during type inference.
