## Introduction {-}

Kotlin took inspiration from many programming languages, including (but not limited to) Java, Scala, C# and Groovy.
One of the main ideas behind Kotlin is being *pragmatic*, i.e., being a programming language useful for day-to-day development, which helps the users get the job done via its features and its tools.
Thus, a lot of design decisions were and still are influenced by how beneficial these decisions are for Kotlin users.

Kotlin is a multiplatform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language.
Currently, as of version 1.5, it supports compilation to the following platforms.

* JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
* JS (JavaScript)
* Native (native binaries for various architectures)

Furthermore, it supports transparent interoperability between different platforms via its Kotlin Multiplatform Project (Kotlin MPP) feature.

The type system of Kotlin distinguishes at compile time between nullable and not-nullable types, achieving null-safety, i.e., guaranteeing the absence of runtime errors caused by the absence of value (i.e., `null` value).
Kotlin also extends its static type system with elements of gradual and flow typing, for better interoperability with other languages and ease of development.

Kotlin is an object-oriented language which also has a lot of functional programming elements.
From the object-oriented side, it supports nominal subtyping with bounded parametric polymorphism (akin to generics) and mixed-site variance.
From the functional programming side, it has first-class support for higher-order functions and lambda literals. 

This specification covers Kotlin/Core, i.e., fundamental parts of Kotlin which should function *mostly* the same way irregardless of the underlying platform.
These parts include such important things as language [expressions], [declarations], [type system] and [overload resolution].

> Important: due to the complexities of platform-specific implementations, platforms may extend, reduce or change the way some aspects of Kotlin/Core function.
> We mark these platform-dependent Kotlin/Core fragments in the specification to the best of our abilities.

Platform-specific parts of Kotlin and its multiplatform capabilities will be covered in their respective sub-specifications, i.e., Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Native.

### Compatibility {-}

Kotlin Language Specification is still in progress and has **experimental** stability level, meaning no compatibility should be expected between even incremental releases, any functionality can be added, removed or changed without warning.

### Experimental features {-}

In several cases this specification discusses *experimental* Kotlin features, i.e., features which are still in active development and which may be changed in the future.
When so, the specification talks about the *current* state of said features, with no guarantees of their future stability (or even existence in the language).

The experimental features are marked as such in the specification to the best of our abilities.
