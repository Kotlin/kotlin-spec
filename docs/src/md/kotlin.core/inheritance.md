## Inheritance

Kotlin is an object-oriented language with its object model based on **inheritance**.

### Classifier type inheritance

Classifier types may be inherited from each other: the type inherited *from* is called the *base type*, while the type which inherits the base type is called the *derived type*.
The following limitations are imposed on the possible inheritance structure.

A class or object type is allowed to inherit from only one class type (called its **direct superclass**) and multiple interface types.
As specified in the [declaration section][Class declaration], if the superclass of a class or object type is not specified, it is assumed to be [`kotlin.Any`][`kotlin.Any`].
This means, among other things, that every class or object type always has a direct superclass.

A class is called **closed** and cannot be inherited from if it is not explicitly declared as either `open` or `abstract`.

> Note: classes are neither `open` nor `abstract` by default.

A [`data class`][Data class declaration], [`enum class`][Enum class declaration] or [`annotation class`][Annotation class declaration] cannot be declared `open` or `abstract`, i.e., are always closed and cannot be inherited from.
Declaring a class `sealed` also implicitly declares it `abstract`.

An interface type may be inherited from any number of other interface types (and only interface types), if the resulting type is [well-formed][Parameterized classifier types].

Object types cannot be inherited from.

Inheritance is the primary mechanism of introducing [subtyping relations][Subtyping] between user-defined types in Kotlin.
When a classifier type $A$ is declared with base types $B_1, \dots, B_m$, it introduces subtyping relations $A <: B_1, \ldots, A <: B_m$, which are then used in [overload resolution][Overload resolution] and [type inference][Type inference] mechanisms.

#### Abstract classes {#abstract-classes-inheritance}

A class declared `abstract` cannot be instantiated, i.e., an object of this class cannot be created directly.
Abstract classes are implicitly `open` and their primary purpose is to be inherited from.
Abstract classes (similarly to [interfaces][Interface declaration]) allow for `abstract` [property][Property declaration] and [function][Function declaration] declarations in their scope.

#### Sealed classes and interfaces

A class or interface (but not a [functional interface][Functional interface declaration]) may be declared `sealed`, making it special from the inheritance point-of-view.

- A `sealed` class is implicitly `abstract` (and these two modifiers are exclusive);
- A `sealed` class or interface can only be inherited from by types declared in the same package and in the same [module][Modules], and which have a fully-qualified name (meaning local and anonymous types cannon be inherited from `sealed` types);
- `Sealed` classes and interfaces allow for exhaustiveness checking of [when expressions][Exhaustive when expressions] for values of such types.
  Any sealed type `S` is associated with its *direct non-sealed subtypes*: a set of non-sealed types, which are either direct subtypes of `S` or transitive subtypes of `S` via some number of other *sealed* types.
  These direct non-sealed subtypes form the boundary for exhaustiveness checks.

#### Inheritance from built-in types

[Built-in types][Built-in types] follow the same rules as user-defined types do.
Most of them are closed class types and cannot be inherited from.
[Function types][Function types] are treated as interfaces and can be inherited from as such.

### Matching and subsumption of declarations

A callable declaration $D$ *matches* to a callable declaration $B$ if the following are true.

* $B$ and $D$ have the same name;
* $B$ and $D$ are declarations of the same kind (property declarations or function declarations);
* [Function signature][Function signature] of $D$ (if any) matches function signature of $B$ (if any).

A callable declaration $D$ *subsumes* a callable declaration $B$ if the following are true.

* $B$ and $D$ match;
* The classifier of $B$ (where it is declared) is a supertype of the classifier of $D$.

The notions of matching and subsumption are used when talking about how declarations are [inherited][Inheriting] and [overridden][Overriding].

### Inheriting

A callable declaration (that is, a [property][Property declaration] or [member function][Function declaration] declaration) inside a classifier declaration is said to be *inheritable* if:

- Its visibility (and the visibility of its getter and setter, if present) is not `private`.

If the declaration $B$ of the base classifier type is inheritable, no other inheritable declaration from the base classifier types subsume $B$, no declarations in the derived classifier type [override][Overriding] $B$, then $B$ is *inherited* by the derived classifier type.

As Kotlin is a language with single inheritance (only one supertype can be a class, any number of supertypes can be an interface), there are several additional rules which refine how declarations are inherited.

* If a derived class type inherits a declaration from its superclass, no other matching *abstract* declarations from its superinterfaces are inherited.

* If a derived classifier type inherits *several* matching *concrete* declarations from its supertypes, it is a compile-time error (this means a derived classifier type should override such declarations).
* If a derived *concrete* classifier type inherits an *abstract* declaration from its supertypes, it is a compile-time error (this means a derived classifier type should override such declaration).
* If a derived classifier type inherits both an *abstract* and a *concrete* declaration from its superinterfaces, it is a compile-time error (this means a derived classifier type should override such declarations).

TODO(Examples)

### Overriding

A callable declaration (that is, a [property][Property declaration] or [member function][Function declaration] declaration) inside a classifier declaration is said to be *overridable* if:

- Its visibility (and the visibility of its getter and setter, if present) is not `private`;
- It is declared as `open`, `abstract` or `override` (interface methods and properties are implicitly `abstract` if they don't have a body or `open` if they do).

It is illegal for a declaration to be both `private` and either `open`, `abstract` or `override`, such declarations should result in a compile-time error.

If the declaration $B$ of the base classifier type is overridable, the declaration $D$ of the derived classifier type subsumes $B$, and $D$ has an `override` modifier, then $D$ is *overriding* the base declaration $B$.

A function declaration $D$ which overrides function declaration $B$ should satisfy the following conditions.

- Return type of $D$ is a subtype of return type of $B$;
- [Suspendability][Coroutines] of $D$ and $B$ must be the same.

A property declaration $D$ which overrides property declaration $B$ should satisfy the following conditions.

- Mutability of $D$ is not stronger than mutability of $B$ (where read-only `val` is stronger than mutable `var`);
- Type of $D$ is a subtype of type of $B$; except for the case when both $D$ and $B$ are mutable (`var`), then types of $D$ and $B$ must be equivalent.

Otherwise, it is a compile-time error.

If the base declaration is not overridable and/or the overriding declaration does not have an `override` modifier, it is not permitted and should result in a compile-time error.

If the overriding declaration *does not* have its visibility specified, its visibility is implicitly set to be the same as the visibility of the overridden declaration.

If the overriding declaration *does* have its visibility specified, it must not be stronger than the visibility of the overridden declaration.

> Examples:
> ```kotlin 
> open class B {
>     protected open fun f() {}
> }
> class C : B() {
>     open override fun f() {}
>     // `f` is protected, as its visibility is
>     //   inherited from the base declaration
> }
> class D : B() {
>     public open override fun f() {}
>     // this is correct, as public visibility is
>     //   weaker that protected visibility
>     //   from the base declaration
> }
> 
> open class P {
>     open fun g() {}
> }
> 
> class Q : P() {
>     protected open override fun g() {}
>     // this is an error, as protected visibility is
>     //   stronger that public visibility
>     //   from the base declaration
> }
> ```

> Important: platforms may introduce additional cases of both *overridability* and *subsumption* of declarations, as well as limit the overriding mechanism due to implementation limitations.

> Note: Kotlin does not have a concept of full hiding (or shadowing) of declarations.

> Note: if a declaration binds a new function to the same name as was introduced in the base class, but which does not subsume it, it is neither a compile-time error nor an overriding declaration.
> In this case these two declarations follow the normal rules of [overloading][Overload resolution].
> However, these declarations may still result in a compile-time error as a result of [conflicting overload][Conflicting overloads] detection.
