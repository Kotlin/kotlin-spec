## Inheritance

TODO(This is a stub)

### Classifier type inheritance

Kotlin is an object-oriented language with its object model based on **inheritance**.
Classifier types may be inherited from each other: the type inherited *from* is called the base type, while the type that inherits the base type is called the derived type.
A class or object type is allowed to inherit from only one class type (called its **direct superclass**) and multiple interface types.
Object types cannot be inherited from.
As specified in the declaration section, if the superclass of a class or object type is not specified, it is assumed to be `kotlin.Any` as all the types are inherited from it.
This means, among other things, that every class or object type has a direct superclass type.

A class is called closed and is forbidden to be inherited from if it is declared not `open` or `abstract` (please note that classes are neither `open` nor `abstract` by default). 
A `data class` cannot be declared `open` or `abstract` and cannot be inherited from.

An interface type may be inherited from any number of other interface types (and only interface types) without any limitation.

Inheritance is the primary mechanism of introducing [subtyping relations][Subtyping] between user-defined types in Kotlin.
When a classifier type $A$ is declared with base types $B_1, \dots, B_i$ it introduces subtyping relations $A <: B_1, \ldots, A <: B_i$, which are then used in  [overload resolution] and [type inference] mechanisms.

#### Sealed classes

A class may be declared `sealed`, making it special from the inheritance point-of-view:

- A `sealed` class is implicitly `abstract` (and these two modifiers are exclusive);
- It can only be inherited from by class and object types declared in the same file (including class and object types declared as nested classes for this class, but not nested classes for other classes);
- It allows for [exhaustiveness checking of when expressions][When-expressions] for values of this type.

#### Inheritance from built-in types

[Built-in types][Built-in types] follow the same rules user-defined types do.
Most of them are closed class types and cannot be inherited from. 
[Function types][Function types] are treated as interfaces and can be inherited from as such.

### Overriding

A callable declaration (that is, a property or member function declaration) inside a classifier declaration is said to be *overridable* if:

- Its visibility (and the visibility of its getter and/or setter) is not `private`;
- It is declared as `open`, `abstract` or `override` (interface methods and properties are implicitly `abstract`).

A callable declaration inside a classifier declaration *subsumes* a corresponding declaration of the base classifier type if:

- Its return type is a subtype of the return type of the corresponding declaration;
- Its formal parameter types are supertypes of the types of corresponding parameters from the corresponding declaration;
- Its name is the same as the name of the corresponding declaration.

TODO(visibility games)

If the declaration of the base classifier type is overridable and the declaration of the derived classifier type subsumes it and it has an `override` modifier, it is `overriding` the base declaration.

If the base declaration is not overridable and/or the deriving declaration does not have an `override` modifier, it is not permitted and should result in a compile-time error.

> Note: Kotlin does not have a concept of full shadowing of declarations.

Platforms may introduce additional cases of both *overridability* and *subsumption* of declarations, as well as limit the overriding mechanism due to internal representation limitations.

> Note: if a declaration binds a new function to the same name as was introduced in the base class, but does not subsume it, it is neither a compiler error nor an overriding declaration.
> In this case these two declarations just follow the normal rules of [function overloading][Overload resolution].
